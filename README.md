SAP Analytics Cloud – Sales Analytics 

This repository demonstrates my technical and analytical skills in building end-to-end business intelligence solutions with SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC).
The included dashboards (PDF exports) represent a comprehensive sales analytics case study, where I applied expertise in data modeling, dashboard engineering, KPI design, and analytical storytelling.

**Core Competencies:**
**Data Modeling & Preparation:**

Designed a multi-dimensional SAC model (ACA01_01_AMODEL_A252) with hierarchies for Customer, Product, Region, Channel, and Sales Org.

Created calculated measures at the model level (Profit, Profit %, moving averages, forecast metrics).

Incorporated scenario planning by applying growth factors for forecasting.

Applied semantic structuring to ensure measures and dimensions aligned with business terminology.

**Story & Dashboard Development:**
Built multi-page SAC stories leveraging all page types: Responsive, Canvas, and Grid.
Engineered dashboards with linked analysis to connect charts and tables dynamically.
Implemented story filters and input controls (e.g., year selectors, product filters) to maximize interactivity.
Applied variance charts, trellis views, and composite KPIs to highlight performance drivers.
Ensured responsive layouts and reusable templates for consistency and scalability.

**Visualization & UX Design:**
Applied data-driven storytelling techniques, layering detailed tables with intuitive charts.
Designed trellis charts for multi-segment comparison (customers, products, regions).
Enhanced readability through styling, preferences, and conditional formatting.
Structured dashboards for both executive-level KPIs and operational detail.
Built placeholders for geo-enriched maps and hierarchical manager views.

**Analytical Methods Applied:**
Time-Series Analysis: tracked revenue, cost, and discounts across multiple periods.
Rolling Metrics: implemented 12-month moving averages for smoothing trends.
Profitability Analysis: designed Profit % calculations by customer, product, and region.
Variance Analysis: compared actuals vs. expected performance across dimensions.
Scenario Forecasting: applied growth-factor models for future revenue projections.
Benchmarking: compared regions, product groups, and sales orgs on both revenue and margin.

**Repository Contents:**
SALESANALYSIS1.pdf – Customer/Product KPI tables, trellis charts, time-series.
SALESANALYSIS2.pdf – Regional & Product Group benchmarking.
SALESANALYSIS3.pdf – Profitability extensions, Profit %, growth-factor forecasting.
SALESANALYSIS4.pdf – Year filters, cost vs. discount trends, rolling profit analysis.

**Technical Strengths Demonstrated:**
End-to-end BI pipeline: from raw data → SAC model → interactive dashboards.
Expert KPI modeling: created derived metrics (Profit, Profit %, rolling averages, scenario-based forecasts).
Advanced story engineering: multiple page types, linked analysis, input controls, and styling consistency.
Analytical versatility: combined time analysis, variance, benchmarking, and profitability assessment in one story.

Scalable dashboard design: layouts and templates structured for reusability across teams.

Business + Technical integration: connected sales performance metrics with strategic business insights.
